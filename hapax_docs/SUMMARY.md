# Hapax Documentation MCP Server - Summary

## Project Overview

We've created a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server specifically designed to help AI assistants like Claude understand and implement Hapax effectively. This server indexes both the curated documentation in `agent_docs/` and the actual Hapax source code, providing powerful search and retrieval capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Indexing**
   - Documentation sections and code examples from `agent_docs/`
   - Source code functions, classes, and methods from `hapax/`
   - Code element relationships (e.g., methods within classes)
   - Usage examples across the codebase

2. **Powerful Search Tools**
   - `search_docs`: General search across all content
   - `explore_hapax_topic`: Topic-based exploration
   - `understand_hapax_component`: Component-specific deep dives
   - `get_implementation_guidance`: Contextual implementation help
   - `troubleshoot_issue`: Error-focused troubleshooting

3. **Direct Access Resources**
   - Access to documentation files
   - Access to source code files
   - Access to specific sections and code elements
   - Access to implementation patterns and examples

4. **Guided Assistance**
   - Interactive prompts for different use cases
   - Structured guidance for implementation
   - Troubleshooting flows for common issues
   - Learning paths for core concepts

## Architecture

The server is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Data Models** (`models.py`)
   - Well-defined dataclasses for documentation and code elements
   - Type-safe search result representations
   - Clean interfaces between components

2. **Indexing Engine** (`indexer.py`)
   - AST-based source code parsing
   - Documentation structure extraction
   - Code example identification
   - Efficient search algorithms

3. **MCP Components**
   - Resources for direct content access (`resources.py`)
   - Tools for interactive functionality (`tools.py`)
   - Prompts for guided workflows (`prompts.py`)

4. **Server Infrastructure** (`server.py`, `cli.py`)
   - Lifecycle management with proper initialization
   - Clean integration of all components
   - User-friendly CLI interface

## Usage Patterns for AI Assistants

The server is designed with specific patterns to help AI assistants effectively use Hapax:

1. **Initial Exploration**: Start with broad topic exploration to get context
2. **Component Understanding**: Dive into specific components as needed
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Provide targeted implementation help
4. **Troubleshooting**: Efficiently diagnose and solve errors
5. **Code Example Retrieval**: Find and adapt relevant examples

## Extensibility

The server can be easily extended:

1. Add new documentation files to `agent_docs/`
2. Update the Hapax source code as it evolves
3. Add new tools, resources, or prompts
4. Enhance the indexing with additional metadata

This MCP server transforms the way AI assistants can work with Hapax, providing a comprehensive knowledge base that's accessible through a standardized protocol.
